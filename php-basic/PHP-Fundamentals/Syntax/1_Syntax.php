    > PHP File Extention is 'php'.
    > As PHP File can be mixed with html and js so the code block of php is wrapped
        within a tag. '<?php ?>' if the file is conisted only php code then the end
        tag can be ignored.

    @ Case Sensitivity.

        PHP is Partially Case-Sensitive. That means in some of the case php is 'case-sensitive'
        and in some case php is not case sensitive.
        
        Below where php is case-insensitve.

            # PHP constructs such as if, if-else, if-elseif,switch, while etc.
            # Keyword such as TRUE,FALSE.
            # User Defined function,Class Name.
        
        Below where PHP is case-sensitive.

            # Variables.
    @ Statements

        # A statement is ends with semicolone.
        # A compound Statement uses curly braces to mark a block of code.
    @ White Spaces And line breaks

        # white space and and line break don't have any special meaning.

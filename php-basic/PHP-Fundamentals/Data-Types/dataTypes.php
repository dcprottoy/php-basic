    # php has mainly Three Data Types
        1. Scalar
        2. Compound
        3. Special
    # Scalar Has Four Data Types
        1. Boolean.
        2. Integer.
        3. Float.
        4. String.
    # Compound Has Two Data types
        1. Array.
        2. Object.
    # Special Has Two Data Types
        1. Null.
        2. Resousces.
    

    # Boolean Data Types Repressent Truth value.Wheather It true or false.
    
    -> False,0,'0',0.00,Empty String(""),null,Empty array repressent false, and others repressents true.

    # Integers are whole numbers such as -1, 0, 1, 2â€¦

        -> Use PHP_INT_SIZE to constant to get size of the integer.
        -> Use PHP_INT_MIN and PHP_INT_MAX to get respectedly minimum and maximum number of Integer.
        -> 0 at the start of integer value represents decimal number.
        -> 0b at the start repressents binary number.
        -> 0x repressents hexadecimal number.
        -> +0 or -0 at the start repressents Octal number.

    # Float Numbers are number with decimal points

        -> PHP can repressent approximately not perfectly.
